            We are in the 4IR and there are several changes that are happening
            in Industry. Besides the internal impact and considerations, these
            changes are going to have an impact on the communities we operate
            in, specifically on Education and the ability to obtain
            jobs/employment. The labour market demands much higher levels of
            agility than ever before. Successful entrants into the labour market
            must have the ability to continuously reskill themselves and they
            must be comfortable transacting with and manipulating technology to
            suit their needs. The nature of jobs is also changing towards
            higher-skilled jobs despite automation. And therefore, Education
            needs to produce school leavers that are equipped for this new
            environment. Most importantly, school leavers need to be agile, able
            to be re-skilled continuously, have an entrepreneurial spirit and
            able to adapt to new technologies seamlessly.

          <p>
            The role of technology in education continues to evolve as
            innovations emerge and schools increasingly introduce ICT as part of
            teaching and learning strategies. The potential benefits of
            information technology in education include:
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Providing more creative learning experiences
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improving behaviour
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improving engagement and knowledge of IT
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improving attendance
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Boosting results
            <br />
            •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reducing the attainment gap
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            Anglo American, through its AASA Education Programme, has embarked
            on an initiative to br/ing digital and ICT skills to its communities
            through their schools and students. Anglo American, in partnership
            with The Impact Catalyst, are ensuring adequate connectivity at all
            schools, with free wifi, by end 2021. Anglo American will also be
            providing all supported schools (109) with devices that will assist
            students and teachers in adopting ICT learning and development into
            the classroom; providing students and teachers with an
            education-based platform for all zero-rated education content; and
            run various sprints to help build ICT skills amongst the youth.
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            To support the ICT adoption into our schools, we are aiming to
            develop ICT Champions who can support us on the ground and drive
            usage and adoption in the schools, and with the teachers and
            students. Anglo American is therefore kicking off an ICT Champion
            Learnership.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            The learnership will run across a 12-month period (Febr/uary –
            January). Leaners will be selected from the outgoing matric class in
            the AASA Schools, through the career guidance intervention. Leaners
            will be asked to apply and selected through key criteria. Those with
            high potential and a passion for IT will be considered for the
            learnership. The learnership will include both formal and on-the-job
            training. Learners will also be expected to manage an ICT champion
            role across a few schools to help Anglo American drive ICT adoption
            and skills.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>ICT CHAMPION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES&nbsp;</strong>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            Becoming an ICT champion provides a fast-track route to success for
            youth who want to make a difference to the lives of their learners,
            improve the awareness of ICT in schools and local communities, all
            while boosting their own careers. Through this tole, you will gain
            ICT related work experience whilst helping to modernise the teaching
            and learning environments in our local community schools. It offers
            the opportunity to develop numerous skills that will be vital when
            seeking to further your studies or find employment.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            As an ICT Champion, you will be able to influence how technology is
            used in a school. This is crucial because, while schools in South
            Africa are moving towards digitalisation, it can be tempting to
            focus on the latest new development rather than those things that
            will make a needed difference to teachers and learners.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            The ICT Champion will support Anglo American by:assisting to get
            devices setup, adopted and used in schools; support both teachers to
            focus on the benefits of technology when it comes to achieving
            educational goals; and help learners embr/ace technology and build
            their ICT skills.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />

          </p>
          <br />

            trainings are required for Champions for their own personal
            development but also to support the ICT programme in the AASA

            management, teachers and learners to share information about the ICT
            programme, new initiatives and future events. The ICT Champions
            serve as a primary point of contact between the AASA ICT
